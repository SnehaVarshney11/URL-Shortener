# URL-Shortener
A URL shortener is a simple tool that takes a long URL and turns it into whatever URL you would like it to be.<br>
There are two options, user can choose- <br>
1. To generate URL from given id,<br>
2. To generate URL from given big URL.<br>
For designing, hashing method is used.<br>
A URL character can be one of the following ->  
1) A lower case alphabet [‘a’ to ‘z’], total 26 characters 
2) An upper case alphabet [‘A’ to ‘Z’], total 26 characters 
3) A digit [‘0’ to ‘9’], total 10 characters
There are total 26 + 26 + 10 = 62 possible characters.<br>
The task is to convert decimal number to base 62 number and convert large url to tiny url.
